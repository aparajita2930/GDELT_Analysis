# GDELT_Analysis

GDELT (Global Database of Events, Language and Tone) is a huge datastore of events, the countries involved in the events, the significance of the events as obtained from the NumArts column among many other such columns. NumArts denotes the number of times an event has been mentioned in the news media. My project involves analyzing the events and their geospatial distribution. For simplicity (due to computational resource constraints: 8GB RAM, 500GB hard disk), I chose to perform analysis on the GDELT reduced data set. A few of the analysis performed involve:
1. The top most significant events worldwide
2. The top most recurring events worldwide
3. Analyzing if there is a correlation between the significant events and recurring events
4. The events that originated in the USA or had their target as USA.
5. The countries that were involved in 'Material Conflict' with each other and viewing them geospatially.
In the future though with better resources, my plan is to extend my analysis on the entire GDELT dataset and also on a special graph available of disease outbreaks worldwide.
